#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** uconv

This is a great formula for working with spreadsheets.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defmath uconv (expression new-units)
    "Perform unit conversion on a calc expression.

    or

    (calcFunc-uconv (calc-eval \"44 degF\" 'raw) \"degC\")


Here is a more complicated example that sums a column of distances and converts
the result to use miles (formatted to 2 decimal places):

    '(calcFunc-uconv (calc-eval (mapconcat 'identity (list @III..@IIII) \" + \") 'raw) \"mi\");%.2f mi

* Load Private settings

These are things like email settings, etc.  I keep them in a file in my
~emacs.d~ directory called ~.private.el~ and I do /not/ save this file in git.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq got/private-settings
      (expand-file-name ".private.el" got/dotfiles-dir))
(when (file-exists-p got/private-settings)
  (load-file got/private-settings))
#+END_SRC

* Load OS-specific Settings File

Path names, etc., will tend to vary from one operating system to
another.  Here we use the =system-type= variable to look for
initialization files named /<system-type>.org/ or /<system-type.el>/
and load them.

Note that on some systems there may be a ~/~ character in the value of
=system-type=; e.g., on Ubuntu the value is ~gnu/linux~, so we convert ~/~ to ~-~
and the file that we look for would be ~gnu-linux.org~ or ~gnu-linux.el~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let* ((system-name (symbol-name system-type))
         (base-name (replace-regexp-in-string "/" "-" system-name)))
    (got/load-file-base-name got/dotfiles-dir base-name))

#+END_SRC

* Library Paths

All configuration is stored under =got/dotfiles-dir= (=~/.emacs.d=).
Meta-information files (backups, etc.) are stored in =got/metafiles-dir=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq got/metafiles-dir "~/.emacs-meta")
(unless (file-exists-p got/metafiles-dir)
       (make-directory got/metafiles-dir))
#+END_SRC
* Load Hostname-specific Settings File

This is yet another more specify place where settings can
go. Here we look for files named <hostname>.org, or <hostname>.el
and load them.

*Note:* With some kind of change in Yosemite, I was getting strange
hostname values; e.g. =gordy30-7....= instead of =gordy30...=.  So I
have updated the regular expression used to generate the /base/
hostname.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((host-name-base (car (split-string (system-name) "[-\\.]"))))
    (got/load-file-base-name got/dotfiles-dir host-name-base))
#+END_SRC

* Custom Settings File

Here I am specifying an alternate location for any custom settings.  This
helps keep my ~init.el~ file cleaner.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" got/metafiles-dir))
#+END_SRC

* Additional Paths

Add all top-level directories in =got/dotfiles-dir= to the load path.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((default-directory user-emacs-directory))
    (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))
#+END_SRC

* Meta-Information

These variables are used to configure where other services store various files that
they create.

* General Emacs Configuration
** Bind-Key
Require ~bind-key~ early so we can use it when configuring
other packages.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'bind-key)
#+END_SRC
** Alarm Bell

The bell rings whenever (ding) is called.  Here we make if flash the frame
rather than make a sound (which I find annoying).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq visible-bell t)
#+END_SRC

** Autocompile

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (require 'auto-compile nil 'noerror)
    (auto-compile-on-load-mode))


#+END_SRC

** Automatic indentation

Using ~C-j~ instead of ~RET~ normally runs the =newline-and-indent=
function.  Since this is so handy I remap ~RET~ to do this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(bind-key "RET" 'newline-and-indent)
#+END_SRC

** Autorevert mode

Automatically revert buffers when they change on disk.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-auto-revert-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Autosave Files

Configure the behaviour of Emacs auto-save.  Here we tell Emacs
where to put the autosave files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix got/auto-save-prefix)
#+END_SRC

** Backup Files

Configure the behaviour of Emacs file backups.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (unless (file-exists-p got/meta-backup)
    (make-directory got/meta-backup t))
  (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,got/meta-backup)))
  (setq make-backup-files t           ; make backup of a file the first time it is saved

        delete-old-versions t         ; delete excess backup versions silently
        delete-by-moving-to-trash nil ; delete excess backup versions directly
        kept-old-versions 2           ; number of oldest versions to keep when new numbered backup made
        kept-new-versions 4           ; number of newest verions to keep when new numbered backup made
        auto-save-default t           ; do auto-saving of every file-visiting buffer
        auto-save-timeout 30          ; number of seconds idle time before auto-save
        auto-save-interval 300        ; number of input events between auto-saves
  )
#+END_SRC

** Bookmarks

Customize where Emacs stores its bookmarks file

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq bookmark-default-file got/bookmark-default-file)
#+END_SRC

** Company Mode

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'company)
    (global-company-mode))
#+END_SRC

Remove company-mode from the mode line.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load "company" '(diminish 'company-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Dired+

Configure ~dired+~ to reuse the directory buffer when navigating about
rather than creating a new buffer for every new directory that is
visited.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (require 'dired+ nil :no-error)
  (diredp-toggle-find-file-reuse-dir 1))
#+END_SRC

** Ediff

You can invoke /ediff/ from within /magit/ by typing ~e~ with the
point on any file in the list of changes.  By default it positions the
two ediff windows on top of each other.  I prefer them to be
side-by-side.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq ediff-split-window-function 'split-window-horizontally)
#+END_SRC

** eshell

Override the default location for /eshell/ control files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq eshell-directory-name got/eshell-directory-name)
#+END_SRC

Have /eshell/ use the same history size as my /HISTSIZE/ environment
variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq eshell-history-size nil)
#+END_SRC

** expand-regiocn

Create ~C-=~ keybinding to invoce the =er/expand-region=
function. This increases selected region by semantic units.

With prefix argument expands the region that many times.
If prefix argument is negative calls `er/contract-region'.
If prefix argument is 0 it resets point and mark to their state
before calling `er/expand-region' for the first time.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'expand-region)
      (bind-key "C-=" 'er/expand-region))
#+END_SRC

** TODO install/configure git-gutter-fringe
** TODO install git-messenger
** Guru Mode

Enable =guru-mode= everywhere.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (guru-global-mode t)
#+END_SRC

Remove guru-mode from the mode line

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load "guru-mode" '(diminish 'guru-mode))

** Jabber

*** fsm-debug

Jabber enables =fsm-debug= by default.  This should be disabled.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq fsm-debug nil)
#+END_SRC

*** OS-Specific Configuration Notes

I store my jabber configuration in my ~.private.el~ file.  Here is a
sample bit of config.  Notice the =--no-ca-verification= argument.
I am including it just as a way to demonstrate how to handle
configuration for a jabber server that may be using a self-signed
certificate, or a signed certificate that ~gnutls-cli~ doesn't know
about.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(when (package-installed-p 'jabber)
  (setq starttls-use-gnutls t
        starttls-gnutls-program "gnutls-cli"
        starttls-extra-arguments '("--starttls" "--insecure" "--no-ca-verification"))

  (setq jabber-account-list
        '(("<my-account-name>@<jabber-server-address>"
           (:network-server . "<jabber-server-address>")
           (:password . "<my-account-password>")
           (:connection-type . ssl)))))

*** Miscellaneous Commands

A couple of useful jabber commands:

- =M-x jabber-connect-all= will connect you to all jabber accounts in
  your =jabber-account-list=.
- =M-x jabber-vcard-edit= will pull down your vcard entry from the
  jabber server and let you edit your information.  From here you can
  also attach a photo of yourself.  There is an 8K file size limit if
  you use this interface.  You /can/ get around this rather easily.
  Before executing the =jabber-vcard-edit= command, just open the file
  ~jabber-vcard.el~, goto the function =jabber-vcard-reassemble=, bump
  up the value used for size comparison (8192) to something bigger,
  and evaluate the function.  After uploading your vcard changes you
  can return the value back to 8192.
- =M-x jabber-groupchat-join= is used to join in with a particular
  discussion group.  If you want to have that happen automatically
  when you connect to a particular jabber server, take a look at the
  next command.
- =M-x jabber-edit-bookmarks= will pull down your current bookmarks on
  a given jabber server.  You can add a bookmark for a particular
  groupchat and check the box to automatically connect to it when
  log-in to that jabber server.

*** Jabber Avatar Cache Settings

Jabber will cache avatar image files.  This controls where those are
stored.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'jabber)
    (setq jabber-avatar-cache-directory got/jabber-avatar-cache))
#+END_SRC

*** Jabber History

The following configures Jabber message history.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'jabber)
    (unless (file-exists-p got/jabber-history)
      (make-directory got/jabber-history))
    (setq jabber-history-enabled t                 ; enable private history
          jabber-history-muc-enabled t             ; enable MUC history
          jabber-history-dir got/jabber-history    ; located here
          jabber-history-size-limit 1024           ; when files get this big
          jabber-history-enable-rotation t         ; then rotate them
          jabber-use-global-history nil)           ; disable global history file
    (custom-set-variables '(jabber-show-resources nil)))

*** Jabber Alerts

From [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/JabberEl#toc15][here]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (require 'jabber nil :noerror)
    (define-jabber-alert echo "Show a message in the echo area"
      (lambda (msg)
        (unless (minibuffer-prompt)
          (message "%s" msg)))))
#+END_SRC

That fix keeps your entry in the echo area from getting clobbered.

*** Jabber Notifications

    ;; This handles multi-user chat buffers
    (add-hook 'jabber-muc-hooks (lambda (nick group buffer text title)

** [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple-cursors]]

To get out of multiple-cursors-mode, press ~RET~ or ~C-g~. The latter

cursors. If you want to insert a newline in multiple-cursors-mode, use
~C-j~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'multiple-cursors)

** Uniquify

The library [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/uniquify][uniquify]] overrides Emacs’ default mechanism for making
buffer names unique (using suffixes like <2>, <3> etc.) with a more
sensible behaviour which use parts of the file names to make the
buffer names distinguishable.

#+END_SRC

** wrap-region

This is a small function that implements a small bit of functionality
that I didn't get from the fantastic /smartparens/ package.  Basically
you mark any region and invoke this function.  It will prompt you to
enter a bit of text and hit RET.  The text you enter will be inserted
around the region.  I have this function bound to =C-c C-g w=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun got/wrap-region (start end  text)
  "Wrap the region delineated by START and END with TEXT"
  (interactive "r\nstext: ")
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char end)
    (insert text)
    (goto-char start)
    (insert text)))


(bind-key "C-c C-g w" 'got/wrap-region)
#+END_SRC

* Theme Configuration

Make my custom themes directory available to Emacs.

- Do ~M-x customize-themes~ to see a list of all your available themes.
- Do ~M-x load-theme~ to load a new theme.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq custom-theme-directory got/themes-dir)
;; EXAMPLE: Loading a new theme
;; specifying the t option to load-theme prevents being asked about
;; loading an unsafe theme.
;; (load-theme 'gordy t)
#+END_SRC


Now let's load a new theme I found.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (require 'color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow nil :noerror)
    (load-theme 'sanityinc-tomorrow-bright t))
#+END_SRC

Lastly, resize the frame, if applicable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

* Mode-Specific Hooks, Notes, and Configuration
** Asciidoc (adoc) Mode

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

	(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.adoc\\'" . adoc-mode)))

#+END_SRC

** cider-mode

Really just a few notes here.  If you want to use /cider/ to connect
to a running ~lein repl~ session, you must make sure to update the
~project.clj~ file and add the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.7.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you do not you will get the following error:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Error: (error "Can't find nREPL middleware providing op \"stacktrace\".
Please, install cider-nrepl 0.7.0-snapshot and restart CIDER")
#+END_EXAMPLE

If this does happen, you will want to kill the ~lein repl~ session.
This will allow Emacs to start accepting input again.

If you want to make this available anytime you run ~lein repl~,
whether or not you are in a project, just do the following instead:

- Create a file called ~profiles.clj~ in ~$HOME/.lein~
- Add this line:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  {:user {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.7.0-SNAPSHOT"]]}}
  #+END_EXAMPLE

** gmail-message-mode

I learned about this mode [[http://endlessparentheses.com/write-gmail-in-emacs-the-easy-way-gmail-message-mode.html?source%3Drss][here.]]  It allows you to compose
browser-based input that accepts HTML using markdown.  Some set-up
notes:

- In Chrome, install the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Edit_with_Emacs][Edit with Emacs]] browser extension
- You should also have the [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][markdown]] or [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/][pandoc]] package installed.  I
  installed markdown via Homebrew.

The following snippet starts the ~edit-server~ so that the browser can
communicate with Emacs.  /Note:/ use ~C-x #~ to complete editing and
send the results back to the browser.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (require 'edit-server nil :noerror)

#+END_SRC

** Javascript mode
*** flycheck-mode for Javascript

Enable =flycheck-mode= when opening a Javascript buffer, if flycheck

/Note:/ For this to work, you should install [[http://www.jshint.com/][jshint]] as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install -g jshint
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'flycheck)
    (if (= (length (shell-command-to-string "which jshint")) 0)

      (add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)))
#+END_SRC

** lisp-mode

Slime configuration for editing Lisp code.  Tell /slime/ what Lisp to
run.  In this case we are configuring it to use [[http://sbcl.org/][Steel Bank Common Lisp]]
by default.  If you invoke ~M-x slime~ with a prefix argument, you
will get to choose between SBCL and CLISP.

/Note:/  I like to use the version of slime that is installed via
quicklisp.  To install it just do the following from inside a lisp
REPL:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(ql:quickload "quicklisp-slime-helper")
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((slime-software (expand-file-name "quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software" (getenv "HOME"))))

You need to install two Python modules outside of Emacs to make this
work:

- [[http://jedi.jedidjah.ch/en/latest/][Jedi]]
- [[http://python-epc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][EPC]]

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pip install jedi
sudo pip install epc
#+END_SRC

Or you may install these packages without root access as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pip install --user jedi
sudo pip install --user epc
#+END_SRC

If the /pip/ command is not available you can install it as follows:

- /Ubuntu:/ ~sudo apt-get install python-pip~
- /Mac OS X:/ ~sudo easy_install pip~

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'jedi)
    (setq jedi:setup-keys t)
    (setq jedi:complete-on-dot t)
    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:setup))

#+END_SRC

** perl-mode

Set indentation level to match what our company uses.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'perl-mode-hook (lambda ()
							  (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
							  (setq perl-indent-level 3)))

#+END_SRC

Enable flycheck

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'flycheck)
    (add-hook 'perl-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode))

#+END_SRC

** shift-select-mode

When non-nil, shifted motion keys activate the mark momentarily.

While the mark is activated in this way, any shift-translated point
motion key extends the region, and if Transient Mark mode was off, it
is temporarily turned on.  Furthermore, the mark will be deactivated
by any subsequent point motion key that was not shift-translated, or
by any action that normally deactivates the mark in Transient Mark mode.

The following setting disables the use of shift+arrows for mark.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq shift-select-mode nil)
#+END_SRC
** resentf-mode
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ORDERED:  t
   :END:

Enable ~recentf~ mode which will save a list of recent files visited.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'recentf)
    (setq recentf-save-file got/meta-recent    ; where to store the file
          recentf-max-saved-items 100          ; save 100 most recent files visited
          recentf-max-menu-items 15            ; max 15 items in the menu
          recentf-auto-cleanup 'never          ; disable before starting
          recentf-mode 1)
    (recentf-mode t))

#+END_SRC

** shen

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'shen-mode nil :noerror)
  (require 'inf-shen nil :noerror)
#+END_SRC

** Term Mode

Disable /yasnippet/ in Term mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'term-mode-hook (lambda ()
                              (yas-minor-mode -1)))
#+END_SRC

** text-mode

Automatically enable auto fill mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+END_SRC

       (require 'twittering-mode nil :noerror)
       (shell-command "which gpg"))
      (setq got/twittering-mode-available t)
    (do
        (warn "not configuring twittering mode - need gnupg installed")
        (setq got/twittering-mode-available nil)))

** undo-tree-mode
Undo-tree-mode replaces Emacs' standard undo feature with a more
powerful yet easier to use version, that treats the undo history
as what it is: a tree.

Enable global undo tree mode if the package is available.  Trigger
visualiztion via ~C-x u~.  Exit by hitting "q" with desired node
active.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (require 'undo-tree nil 'noerror)
    (global-undo-tree-mode))
#+END_SRC

Hide undo-tree minor mode in the modeline:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load "undo-tree" '(diminish 'undo-tree-mode))
#+END_SRC

** whitespace-mode

Configure whitespace visualization.  Here is a breakdown of the
settings that I use.

These are the ~whitespace-style~ options.

| Option           | Description                                                                        |
|------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| face             | enable all visualization via faces                                                 |
| trailing         | trailing blanks are visualized via faces, if ~face~ present in ~whitespace-style~  |
| lines-tail       | lines which have columns beyond ~whitespace-line-column~ are highlighted via faces |
| space-before-tab | SPACEs before TAB visulized if ~indent-tabs-mode~ is non nil                       |
| indentation      | 8 or more SPACESs at beginning of line visualized if ~indent-tabs-mode~ non nil    |
| space-after-tab  | 8 or more SPACEs after TAB visualized if ~indent-tabs-mode~ is non nil             |

The ~whitespace-line-column~ setting specifies the column beyond which
the line is highlighted.  It is used only when ~whitespace-style~
includes ~lines~ or ~lines-tail~.  I have it set for 80 columns.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'whitespace)
    (setq whitespace-style '(
                             face
                             trailing
                             lines-tail
                             space-before-tab
                             indentation
                             space-after-tab
                             ))
    (setq whitespace-line-column 80))

#+END_SRC
** yasnippet-mode

Enable yasnippet everywhere by default.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (package-installed-p 'yasnippet)
    (yas-global-mode))
#+END_SRC

Hide yas minor mode in the mode line.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load "yasnippet" '(diminish 'yas-minor-mode))
#+END_SRC
